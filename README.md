## Instructions
Battle boats is a turn based strategy game where players eliminate their opponents fleet of boats by ‘firing’ at a location on a grid in an attempt to sink them. The first player to sink all of their opponents’ battle boats is declared the winner.

The user has two eight by eight grids. One grid is used for their own battle boats and the other is used to record any hits or misses placed on the computers. At the beginning of the game, the user will decide where they wish to place their fleet of five battle boats.

During game play, players take it in turns to fire at a location on their opponent’s board. They do this by stating the coordinates for their target. If a player hits their opponent's boat then this is recorded as a hit. If they miss then this is recorded as a miss.

The game ends when a player's fleet of boats have been sunk. The winner is the player with boats remaining at the end of the game.
